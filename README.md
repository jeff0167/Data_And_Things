## Inference vs prediction

Inference: to understand and infer relation between input and output values, more advertising more sales?
Prediction: to be able to predict y given independent variables(x) with the least amount of error between actual and predicted values

If prediction is the goal you can go for higher flexible learning methods, like deep learning, though it might overfit
If inference is the goal a inflexible learning method could be desirable, like simple linear regression

## Parametric vs non-Parametric learning methods

Parametric learning methods: simnple and tries to find the best learning model by changing parameters of a given function, like linear regression
doesn't need a lot of data

non-Parametric learning methods: tries different learning methods to find the best learning model, which is more expenisve to run and requires more data
to accurately make good predictions

In general
More flexable, more variance
More flexable less bias

## quotes

"When a given method yields a small training MSE but a large test MSE, we are
said to be overfitting the data." (An introduction to statistical learning, page 30)
